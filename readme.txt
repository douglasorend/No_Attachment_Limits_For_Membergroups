[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod makes a number of changes to the forum so that the following limits don't apply to selected membergroups:
o Maxmimum number of attachments per post
o Maxmimum attachment file size
o Maxmimum size of all attachments per post
o Allowed attachment extensions

With the [url=http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=1974]PM Attachments[/url] mod installed, it also removes the following limits:
o Maxmimum number of attachments per PM
o Maxmimum PM attachment file size
o Maxmimum size of all attachments per PM
o Allowed PM attachment extensions

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Admin Settings[/u][/size][/b][/color]
Under [b]Admin[/b] -> [b]Members[/b] -> [b]Permissions[/b], two permission permissions are available per membergroup: 
o "No Post attachment limits" 
o "No PM attachment limits" (available only with PM Attachments mod installed)
