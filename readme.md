[**By Dougiefresh**](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=253913) -> [Link to Mod](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=3997)

------

## Introduction
This mod makes a number of changes to the forum so that the following limits don't apply to selected membergroups:

- Maxmimum number of attachments per post
- Maxmimum attachment file size
- Maxmimum size of all attachments per post
- Allowed attachment extensions

With the [PM Attachments](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=1974) mod installed, it also removes the following limits:

- Maxmimum number of attachments per PM
- Maxmimum PM attachment file size
- Maxmimum size of all attachments per PM
- Allowed PM attachment extensions

## Admin Settings
Under **Admin** -> **Members** -> **Permissions**, two permission permissions are available per membergroup: 

- "No Post attachment limits" 
- "No PM attachment limits" (available only with PM Attachments mod installed)
